## Modules and Breakouts
### Wireless/RF
- Adafruit [RFM95W Breakout Board](https://adafruit.com/product/3072) as "Breakout_RFM95W" (footprint same).

## MCUs
- Raspberry Pi [RP-2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html) as "RP2040TR7" (footprint QFN40P700X700X90-57N).

## SMD RLC components
### Resistors
- Panasonic [EXB-28VR000X](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-electronic-components/EXB-28VR000X/417360) as "EXB-28VR000X" (footprint RESCAXS50P200X100X45-8N).
- Yageo [YC124-JR-071KL](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/yageo/YC124-JR-071KL/1004996) as "YC124-JR-071KL" (footprint RESCAXS50P200X100X45-8N, same as the EXB because the library footprint glitched).
